Collection of useful scripts I've written for myself.

## Scripts

### merge-spreadsheets
This script was written by prompt with ChatGPT, and I asked it to generate a README including all of the prompts. Very cool!

### file-comparison
This script also written by ChatGPT, compares filenames in two directories and outputs a CSV with the difference.
